        "I enjoyed implementing these functions and testing them out to understand them. Being able to work with the algorithms helped me understand the benefits of pairing numbers together. By pairing a tuple into a single unique number we can retain the original data even though it is encoded into a new number. This in essence lets us use our function, or inverse function, as a key so that you can only know what the number represents if you have the original algorithm. I see that using a pairing function unique to yourself could help when writing encryption software. "

This is because it makes use of squaring the inputs and then dividing them, whereas the f function multiplies multiplies the sums of the inputs together. This means that the larger the inputs get then the larger the difference between the two functions. Another big difference is that function g is able to produce 0 as a result if the inputs are (0,0), whereas for function f the inputs (0,0) still produce 1 as the result. "
