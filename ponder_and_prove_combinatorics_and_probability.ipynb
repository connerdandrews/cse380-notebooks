You select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time.

        "I had a fun time trying to solve the puzzles. I actually asked my family the puzzles to see how they would approach the marble and molecules of air puzzle. It was fun to see them try to work out a way to determine the answers. I learned a lot about how to get code to run for a long period of time and I also learned that when we try to find percentages from extremely large numbers or sets it can take a lot of time to calculate using python.
